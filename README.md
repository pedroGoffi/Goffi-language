## <div id="Aritmetric-Operators">Aritmetric-Operators</div>	
    result of any operation will be pushed automatically ot the top of the stack
	In comparasions `<` or `>` will push 1 if true and 0 if false.
`=` EQUALS operand, Usage: `1 1 =` is equivalent to (1 == 1)

`+`	PLUS operand. Usage:  `2 1 +` is equivalent to (2+1) 

`-`	MINUS operand, Usage: `2 1 -` is equivalent to (2-1) 

`<`	LESS THAN operand, Usage:  `2 1 <` is equivalent to (2<1) 

`>`	GREATER THAN operand, Usage:  `2 1 >` is equivalent to (2>1) 

`*`	MULTIPLY operand, example: `2 1 *` is equivalent to (2*1)

	NOTE 	This will be launched to std.goffi 
    		when i implement procedures
`dump` print the last digit in the stack

`dup` duplicate the last element in the stack
